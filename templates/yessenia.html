<h1 class="bg-primary">Yessenia's short bio!</h1>
<p> I was born in Ayotlan Jalisco, Mexico.</p>
<p> I grew up in Waltham, Massachusetts </p>
<p> My greatest dream is to buy my parents a house because they are the reason for all my achievments.
They are very supportive and have always taught me that school 
comes before anything  </p>
<p> My parents and 11 year old sister live with me in Waltham. But the rest of my family lives in Mexico. </p>
